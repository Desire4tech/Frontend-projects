## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to add shadow, how to make an item centered and responsive.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: flex-start;
     box-shadow: 0px 25px 25px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
}
```
### Continued development

I would still be interested in working with the display properties and box-shadow as well.
